Here’s a **straightforward, execution-focused 14-week internship roadmap** designed the way real engineering teams operate — sprint-based, deliverable-driven, and aligned with **modern MERN + AI + production engineering standards**.

No academic fluff. Every week produces a tangible artifact. By the end, they should have something deployable, not just “learning completed.”

# ✅ Sample Capstone Project Title

**AI-Driven Smart Talent Screening & Skill Intelligence Platform**

---

# ✅ Short Synopsis

A full-stack MERN application that automates candidate screening using AI. Users upload resumes, the system extracts skills using NLP, matches them against job descriptions, ranks candidates, and provides analytics dashboards for recruiters. Includes authentication, role-based access, real-time updates, and cloud deployment. Designed to mirror enterprise hiring platforms with modern engineering standards.
